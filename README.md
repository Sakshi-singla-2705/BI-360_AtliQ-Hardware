# üìä Business Insights 360 - AtliQ Hardware
AtliQ Hardware is a fast-growing electronics company operating in multiple countries. Despite their expansion, they still use Excel files to analyze their business data. However, Excel files can be difficult to work with and don‚Äôt provide deep insights. Because of this lack of effective data analysis, the company suffered a major financial loss in Latin America.

To improve decision-making, AtliQ Hardware uses the Business Insights 360 report. This report gives valuable insights across important departments like Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Product Development, and Executive Management. With this information, the company can make smarter choices and avoid future losses.
